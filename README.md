# Jared's Bang Search

A faster alternative to DuckDuckGo's bang redirects. This project allows you to use DuckDuckGo's bang syntax for quick searches without the slowness of DuckDuckGo's redirects.

## How to Use

1. Add `https://unduck-two.vercel.app?q=%s` as a custom search engine in your browser
2. Set it as your default search engine
3. Use bang syntax like `!g search term` for Google, `!yt search term` for YouTube, etc.
4. Set a default bang for when no bang is specified
